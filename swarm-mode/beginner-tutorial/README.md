# Docker Swarm Tutorial
Docker Engine 1.12 includes swarm mode for natively managing a cluster of Docker Engines called a swarm. You can use the Docker CLI to create a swarm, deploy application services to a swarm, and manage swarm behavior. This tutorial uses [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) to create multiple nodes on your desktop. If you prefer you can create those nodes in your own cloud or on multiple machines.

## Preparation
You need to have Docker and Docker Machine installed on your system. [Download Docker](https://docker.com/getdocker) for your platform and install it.

>**Tips:**
>
* If you are using Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows, you already have Docker Machine, as it is installed with those applications. See [Download Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#/download-docker-for-mac) and [Download Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#/download-docker-for-windows) for install options and details on what gets installed.
>
* If you are using Docker for Windows you will need to use the Hypver-V driver for Docker Machine. That will require a bit more set-up. See the [Microsoft Hyper-V driver documentation](https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/hyper-v/) for directions on setting it up.
>
* If you are using Docker directly on a Linux system, you will need to [install Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) (after installing [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/)).

## Creating the nodes and Swarm
[Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/) can be used to:
* Install and run Docker on Mac or Windows
* Provision and manage multiple remote Docker hosts
* Provision Swarm clusters

But it can also be used to create multiple nodes on your local machine. There's a [bash script](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/swarm-mode/beginner-tutorial/swarm-node-vbox-setup.sh) in this repository that does just that and creates a swarm. There's also [a powershell Hyper-V version](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/swarm-mode/beginner-tutorial/swarm-node-hyperv-setup.ps1). On this page we're walking through the bash script, but the steps, aside from set-up, are a basically the same for the Hyper-V version.

This first step creates three machines, and names the machines manager1, manager2, and manager3
```
#!/bin/bash

# Swarm mode using Docker Machine

#This configures the number of workers and managers in the swarm
managers=3
workers=3

# This creates the manager machines
echo "======> Creating $managers manager machines ...";
for node in $(seq 1 $managers);
do
	echo "======> Creating manager$node machine ...";
	docker-machine create -d virtualbox manager$node;
done
```

This second step creates three more machines, and names them worker1, worker2, and worker3
```
# This create worker machines
echo "======> Creating $workers worker machines ...";
for node in $(seq 1 $workers);
do
	echo "======> Creating worker$node machine ...";
	docker-machine create -d virtualbox worker$node;
done

# This lists all machines created
docker-machine ls
```

Next you create a swarm by initializing it on the first manager. You do this by using `docker-machine ssh` to run `docker swarm init`
```
# initialize swarm mode and create a manager
echo "======> Initializing first swarm manager ..."
docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker swarm init --listen-addr $(docker-machine ip manager1) --advertise-addr $(docker-machine ip manager1)"
```
Next you get join tokens for managers and workers.

```
# get manager and worker tokens
export manager_token=`docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker swarm join-token manager -q"`
export worker_token=`docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker swarm join-token worker -q"`
```

Then join the other masters to the Swarm
```
for node in $(seq 2 $managers);
do
	echo "======> manager$node joining swarm as manager ..."
	docker-machine ssh manager$node \
		"docker swarm join \
		--token $manager_token \
		--listen-addr $(docker-machine ip manager$node) \
		--advertise-addr $(docker-machine ip manager$node) \
		$(docker-machine ip manager1)"
done
```

Finally, add the worker machines and join them to the swarm.
```
# workers join swarm
for node in $(seq 1 $workers);
do
	echo "======> worker$node joining swarm as worker ..."
	docker-machine ssh worker$node \
	"docker swarm join \
	--token $worker_token \
	--listen-addr $(docker-machine ip worker$node) \
	--advertise-addr $(docker-machine ip worker$node) \
	$(docker-machine ip manager1):2377"
done

# show members of swarm
docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker node ls"
```

That last line will show you a list of all the nodes, something like this:

```
ID                           HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
3cq6idpysa53n6a21nqe0924h    manager3  Ready   Active        Reachable
64swze471iu5silg83ls0bdip *  manager1  Ready   Active        Leader
7eljvvg0icxlw20od5f51oq8t    manager2  Ready   Active        Reachable
8awcmkj3sd9nv1pi77i6mdb1i    worker1   Ready   Active        
avu80ol573rzepx8ov80ygzxz    worker2   Ready   Active        
bxn1iivy8w7faeugpep76w50j    worker3   Ready   Active        
```
You can also find all your machines by running
```
$ docker-machine ls
NAME       ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER    ERRORS
manager1   -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v1.12.1   
manager2   -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.101:2376           v1.12.1   
manager3   -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.102:2376           v1.12.1   
worker1    -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.103:2376           v1.12.1   
worker2    -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.104:2376           v1.12.1   
worker3    -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.105:2376           v1.12.1   
```

The next step is to create a service and list out the services. This creates a single service called `web` that runs the latest nginx:
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service create -p 80:80 --name web nginx:latest"
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service ls"
ID            NAME  REPLICAS  IMAGE         COMMAND
2x4jsk6313az  web   1/1       nginx:latest  
```
Now open the machine address in your browser. You can see above manager1 had a URL of 192.168.99.100
![nginx in Chrome at 192.168.99.100](images/manager1-nginx.png)

You can actually load any of the node ip addresses and get the same result because of Swarm Mode's Routing Mesh.
![nginx in Chrome at 192.168.99.100](images/manager2-nginx.png)

Next let's inspect the service
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service inspect web"

        }
    }
]
```

That's lots of info! Now, let's scale the service:
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service scale web=15"
web scaled to 15
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service ls"
ID            NAME  REPLICAS  IMAGE         COMMAND
2x4jsk6313az  web   15/15     nginx:latest  
```
Docker has spread the 15 services evenly over all of the nodes
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service ps web"
ID                         NAME    IMAGE         NODE      DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE           ERROR

```

You can also drain a particular node, that is remove all services from that node. The services will automatically be rescheduled on other nodes.
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker node update --availability drain worker1"
worker1
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service ps web"
ID                         NAME        IMAGE         NODE      DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE           ERROR

```

You can check out the nodes and see that `worker1` is still active but drained.
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker node ls"
ID                           HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
3cq6idpysa53n6a21nqe0924h    manager3  Ready   Active        Reachable

bxn1iivy8w7faeugpep76w50j    worker3   Ready   Active
```

You can also scale down the service
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service scale web=10"
web scaled to 10
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker service ps web"
ID                         NAME        IMAGE         NODE      DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE            ERROR

```

Now bring `worker1` back online and show it's new availability
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker node update --availability active worker1"
worker1
Manos-MacBook-Pro:beginner-tutorial manomarks$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker node inspect worker1 --pretty"

 ```

Now let's take the manager1 node, the leader, out of the Swarm
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager1 "docker swarm leave --force"
Node left the swarm.
```

Wait about 30 seconds just to be sure. The Swarm still functions, but must elect a new leader. This happens automatically.
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager2 "docker node ls"
ID                           HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
3cq6idpysa53n6a21nqe0924h    manager3  Ready   Active        Reachable
64swze471iu5silg83ls0bdip    manager1  Down    Active        Unreachable
7eljvvg0icxlw20od5f51oq8t *  manager2  Ready   Active        Leader
8awcmkj3sd9nv1pi77i6mdb1i    worker1   Ready   Active        
avu80ol573rzepx8ov80ygzxz    worker2   Ready   Active        
bxn1iivy8w7faeugpep76w50j    worker3   Ready   Active
```
You see that `manager1` is Down and Unreachable and `manager2` has been elected leader. It's also easy to remove a service:
```
$ docker-machine ssh manager2 "docker service rm web"
web
```

## Cleanup
There's also a [bash script](https://github.com/ManoMarks/labs/blob/master/swarm-mode/beginner-tutorial/swarm-node-vbox-teardown.sh) that will clean up your machine by removing all the Docker Machines.

```
