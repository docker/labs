  * CORS is like a more modern version of JSONP-- it allows your application *
  * to circumvent browsers' same-origin policy, so that the responses from   *
  * your Sails app hosted on one domain (e.g. example.com) can be received   *
  * in the client-side JavaScript code from a page you trust hosted on _some *
  * other_ domain (e.g. trustedsite.net).                                    *
  *                                                                          *

  * By default, Sails' built-in CSRF protection is disabled to facilitate     *
  * rapid development.  But be warned!  If your Sails app will be accessed by *
  * web browsers, you should _always_ enable CSRF protection before deploying *
  * to production.                                                            *
