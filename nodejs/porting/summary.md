# What we done so far

* setup Docker for a simple Node.js / MongoDB application

* created image for the application
  * containing all the parts to run the application (runtime Node.js, librairies, application code)

* portable image (dev / test / qa / prod) available through the Docker Hub

* scalability of the application (API)
  * on a single node (for dev / test purposes)
  * on a cluster of Docker hosts
  * on a Docker Swarm

* We also seen several Docker components and how they are integrated together
