= Docker for AWS

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/[Docker for AWS] is a CloudFormation template that configures Docker in swarm-mode, running on EC2 instances backed by custom AMIs. This allows to create a cluster of Docker Engine in swarm-mode with a single click. This workshop will take the https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/developer-tools/java/chapters/ch06-swarm.adoc#multi-container-application[multi-container application] and deploy it on multiple hosts.

=== Requirements

What is required for creating this CloudFormation template?

. https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/iam-permissions/[Permissions]
. SSH key in AWS in the region where you want to deploy (required to access the completed Docker install). http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 Key Pair] explains how to add SSH key to your account
. AWS account that support EC2-VPC

=== Create swarm-mode cluster

https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=Docker&templateURL=https://editions-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/aws/stable/Docker.tmpl[Launch Stack] to create the CloudFormation template.

.Select template
image::docker-aws-1.png[]

Click on `Next`

.Swarm size
image::docker-aws-2.png[]

Select the number of Swarm manager (1) and worker (3) nodes. This wll create a 4 node cluster. Select the SSH key that will be used to access the cluster.

By default, the template is configured to redirect all log statements to CloudWatch. Until https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/30691[#30691] is fixed, the logs will only be available using CloudWatch. Alternatively, you may select to not redirect logs to CloudWatch. In this case, the usual command to get the logs will work.

Scroll down to select manager and worker properties.

.Swarm manager/worker properties
image::docker-aws-3.png[]

`m3.medium` (1 vCPU and 3.75 GB memory) is a good start for manager. `m3.large` (2 vCPU and 7.5 GB memory) is a good start for worker node. Make sure the EC2 instance size is chosen to accommodate the processing and memory needs of containers that will run there.

Click on `Next`

.Swarm options
image::docker-aws-4.png[]

Take default for all the options and click on `Next`.

.Swarm review
image::docker-aws-5.png[]

.Swarm IAM accept
image::docker-aws-6.png[]

Accept the checkbox for CloudFormation to create IAM resources. Click on `Create` to create the Swarm cluster.

It will take a few minutes for the CloudFormation template to complete. For example, it took about 10-12 minutes for this cluster to be created in `us-west-2` region. The output will look like:

.Swarm CloudFormation complete
image::docker-aws-7.png[]

https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances:search=docker;sort=instanceState[EC2 Console] will show the EC2 instances for manager and worker.

.EC2 console
image::docker-aws-8.png[]

Select the manager node, copy the public IP address:

[[Swarm_manager]]
.Swarm manager
image::docker-aws-9.png[]

Create a SSH tunnel using the command `ssh -i ~/.ssh/arun-cb-west2.pem -NL localhost:2374:/var/run/docker.sock docker@ec2-52-37-65-169.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com &`

Get more details about the cluster using the command `docker -H localhost:2374 info`. This shows the output:

=== Multi-container application to multi-host

Use the Compose file as defined at https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/developer-tools/java/chapters/ch06-swarm.adoc#multi-container-application[Multi-container Application] to deploy a multi-container application to this Docker cluster. This will deploy a multi-container application to multiple hosts. The command is:

```
docker -H localhost:2374 stack deploy --compose-file=docker-compose.yml webapp
```

The output is:

```
Creating network webapp_default
Creating service webapp_db
Creating service webapp_web
```

WildFly and Couchbase services are started on this cluster. Each service has a single container. A new overlay network is created. This allows multiple containers on different hosts to communicate with each other.

=== Verify service/containers in application

Verify that the WildFly and Couchbase services are running using `docker -H localhost:2374 service ls`:

```
ID            NAME        MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE
bfi9s7t5sdjo  webapp_db   replicated  1/1       arungupta/couchbase:travel
ij04s9di00xw  webapp_web  replicated  1/1       arungupta/couchbase-javaee:travel
```

`REPLICAS` colum shows that one of one replica for the container is running for each service. It might take a few minutes for the service to be running as the image needs to be downloaded on the host where the container is started.

More details about the service can be obtained using `docker -H localhost:2374 service inspect webapp_web`:

Logs for the service cannot be seen using `docker service logs`. This will be fixed with https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/30691[#30691]. Instead they are visible using https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2#logs:prefix=Docker[CloudWatch Logs].

.CloudWatch log group
image::docker-aws-10.png[]

Select the log group:

.CloudWatch log stream
image::docker-aws-11.png[]

Pick `webapp_db.xxx` log stream to see log statements from the Couchbase image:

.CloudWatch database log stream
image::docker-aws-12.png[]

Pick `webapp_db.xxx` log stream to see log statements from the WildFly application server:

.CloudWatch application log stream

=== Access application

Application is accessed using manager's IP address and on port 8080. By default, the port 8080 is not open. In <<Swarm_manager>>, click on `Docker-Managerxxx` in `Security groups`. Click on `Inbound`, `Edit`, `Add Rule`, and create a rule to enable TCP traffic on port 8080.

.Open port 8080 in Docker manager
image::docker-aws-14.png[]

Click on `Save` to save the rules.

Now, the application is accessible using the command `curl -v http://ec2-52-37-65-169.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/airlines/resources/airline` and shows output:

```

```

Complete set of commands are shown at https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/developer-tools/java/chapters/ch05-compose.adoc#access-application. Make sure to replace `localhost` with public IP address of the manager.

=== Shutdown application

Shutdown the application using the command `docker -H localhost:2374 stack rm webapp`:

```
Removing service webapp_db
Removing service webapp_web
Removing network webapp_default
```

This stops the container in each service and removes the services. It also deletes any networks that were created as part of this application.

=== Shutdown cluster

Docker cluster can be shutdown by deleting the stack created by CloudFormataion:
