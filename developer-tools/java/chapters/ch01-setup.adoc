= Setup Environments

This section describes the hardware and software needed for this workshop, and how to configure them. This workshop is designed for a BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) style hands-on-lab.

== Hardware & Software

. Memory: At least 4 GB+, strongly preferred 8 GB
. Operating System: Mac OS X (10.10.3+), Windows 10 Pro+ 64-bit, Ubuntu 12+, CentOS 7+.
+
NOTE: An older version of the operating system may be used. The installation instructions would differ slightly in that case and are explained in the next section.
. Amazon Web Services credentials with the https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/iam-permissions/[following permissions]. This is only needed for some parts of the workshop.

== Install Docker

Docker runs natively on Mac, Windows and Linux. This lab will use https://www.docker.com/community-edition[Docker Community Edition (CE)]. Download the Docker CE edition for your machine from the https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community[Docker Store]. 

NOTE: Docker CE requires a fairly recent operating system version. If your machine does not meet the requirements, then you need to install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox[Docker Toolbox]. 

This workshop is tested with Docker Community Edition `17.09.0-ce-rc2, build 363a3e7` on Mac OS X `10.12.5`.

== Download Images

This tutorial uses a few Docker images and software. Let's download them before we start the tutorial.

Download the file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/labs/master/developer-tools/java/scripts/docker-compose-pull-images.yml and use the following command to pull the required images:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-pull-images.yml pull --parallel

NOTE: For Linux, `docker-compose` and `docker` commands need `sudo` access. So prefix all commands with `sudo`.

== Other Software
