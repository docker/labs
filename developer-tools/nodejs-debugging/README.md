# Tutorial: Debugging Node.js Applications in Docker

Debugging an application live in Node.js is relatively easy. Node developers can use Docker to build a development environment where they can run, test, and live debug code running within a container. Debugging a node.js application was demonstrated at DockerCon 2016 showing that development using containers can be performed on many platforms using other programming languages.
