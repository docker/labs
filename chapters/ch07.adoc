=== Install Docker Tooling in Eclipse

Download http://eclipse.org/[Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers Mars 2] and install.

Go to "`Help`" menu, "`Install New Software...`".

Select Eclipse Mars update site, search for Docker, select "`Docker Tooling`".

Click on "`Next>`", "`Next>`", accept the license agreement, click on "`Finish`" to start the installation.

Restart Eclipse for the installation to complete.

=== Docker Perspective and View

Go to "`Window`", "`Perspective`", "`Open Perspective`", "`Other...`", "`Docker Tooling`".

Click on "`OK`" to see the perspective.

This has three views:

- *Docker Explorer*: a tree view listing all connected Docker instances, with image and containers.
- *Docker Images*: a table view listing containers for selected Docker connection.
- *Docker Containers*: a table view listing containers for selected Docker connection

Click on the text in Docker Explorer to create a new connection. If you are on Mac, you are likely using Docker Toolbox (or Docker Machine) to setup Docker Host.

Enter the values as shown:

The exact value of TCP Connection can be found using `docker-machine ls` command. The path for authentication is the directory name where certificates for your Docker Machine, `couchbase` in this case, are stored.

Click on "`Finish`" to complete the configuration.

Click on Test Connection to make sure the connection is successfully configured.

Docker Explorer is updated to show the connection.

Containers and Images configured for the Docker Machine are shown in tabs. They can be expanded to see the list in Explorer itself.

=== Pull an Image

Expand the connection to see "`Containers`" and "`Images`".

Right-click on "`Images`" and select "`Pull...`".

Type the image name and click on "`Finish`".

This image is now shown in Explorer and Docker Images tab.

Any existing images on the Docker Host will be shown here.

=== Run a Container

Select an image, right-click on it, and click on "`Run...`". It shows the options that can be configured for running the container. Some of them are:

- Publish ports on Docker host interface (`-P` or `-p` in `docker run` command)
- Keep STDIN open and allocate pseudo-TTY (`-it` on CLI)
- Remove container after it exits (`--rm` on CLI)
- Volume mapping (`-v` on CLI)
- Environment variables (`-e` on CLI)

Uncheck "`Publish all exposed ports`" box to map to corresponding ports.

Click on "`Finish`" to run the container.

Right-click on the started container, select "`Display Log`" to show the log.

The container can be paused, stopped and killed from here as well.

To see more details about the container, right-click on the container, select "`Show In`", "`Properties`".

=== Build an Image

In Docker Images tab, click on the hammer icon on top right.

Give the image name, specify an empty directory, click on "`Edit Dockerfile`" to edit the contents of Dockerfile

Click on "`Save`" and "`Finish`" to create the image.
