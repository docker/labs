# Service deployment on a swarm

Script that create a swarm cluster and deploy a simple service.
Swarm is created with Swarm mode of Engine 1.12. Can be created on
* Virtualbox
* Digitalocean
* Amazon EC2

Note: currently, if deploying on AWS, only EU (Ireland) region is available. Make sure you use a Key Pairs for this region

# Usage

```
./swarm.sh [--driver provider]
           [--amazonec2-access-key ec2_access_key]
           [--amazonec2-secret-key ec2_secret_key]
           [--amazonec2-security-group ec2_security_group]
           [--digitalocean_token]
           [-m|--manager nbr_manager]
           [-w|--worker nbr_worker]
           [-r|--replica nbr_replica]
           [-p|--port exposed_port]
           [--service_image image_of_the_service_to_deploy]
           [--service_port port_exposed_by_the_service_to_deploy]
```

Several parameters can be provided
* driver used ("virtualbox", "digitalocean", "amazonec2") (default: "virtualbox")
* number of manager (default: 3)
* number of worker (default: 5)
* number of replicas for the deployed service (lucj/randomcity:1.1) (default: 5)
* port exposed by the cluster (default: 8080)
* digitalocean token (if digitalocean driver specified)
* amazon access key, secret key, security group (currently only for EU (Ireland) region) (if amazonec2 driver is specified)

# Example

Let's create a swarm cluster with 2 manager and 2 worker nodes locally (with virtualbox) and using service lucj/randomCity
Once deployed service will be available on port 8080 (default port)

```
$ ./swarm.sh --manager 2 --worker 2 --service_image lucj/randomCity --service_port 80
->  about to create a swarm with 2 manager(s) and 2 workers on virtualbox machines
-> creating Docker host for manager 1 (please wait)
-> creating Docker host for manager 2 (please wait)
-> creating Docker host for worker 1 (please wait)
-> creating Docker host for worker 2 (please wait)
-> init swarm
Swarm initialized: current node (99xi3bzlgobxmeff573qitctg) is now a manager.
-> join manager 2 to the swarm
Node f4wocnel60xwfn2z522a645ba accepted in the swarm.
-> join worker 1 to the swarm
This node joined a Swarm as a worker.
-> join worker 2 to the swarm
This node joined a Swarm as a worker.
-> deploy service with 5 replicas with exposed port 8080

# Service details

The test service deployed is a simple http server that returns a message with
* the ip of the container that handled the request
* a random city of the world

# Test deployed service

Send several requests to the manager1

```
$ curl 192.168.99.100:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.7 suggests to visit Zebunto"}
$ curl 192.168.99.100:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.8 suggests to visit Areugpip"}
$ curl 192.168.99.100:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.10 suggests to visit Fozbovsav"}
$ curl 192.168.99.100:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.9 suggests to visit Kitunweg"}
$ curl 192.168.99.100:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.11 suggests to visit Aviznuk"}
$ curl 192.168.99.100:8080

$ curl 192.168.99.100:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.8 suggests to visit Palmenme"}
```

Send several requests to the worker2

```
$ curl http://192.168.99.102:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.8 suggests to visit Wehappap"}
$ curl http://192.168.99.102:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.11 suggests to visit Jocuvdam"}
$ curl http://192.168.99.102:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.12 suggests to visit Suvigenuh"}
$ curl http://192.168.99.102:8080
{"message":"10.255.0.9 suggests to visit Jinonat"}
```

The requests are dispatched in a round robin fashion to the running containers.

# Examples with other drivers

## Run 3 managers and 6 workers on DigitalOcean and use service based on ehazlett/docker-demo image (default image if none specified)

```
./swarm.sh --driver digitalocean --digitalocean_token $DO_TOKEN --manager 3 --worker 6
```

Once the service is deployed you got some nice Mobydock :)

![Mobydock](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2330187/docker/labs/1.12/swarm-sample/mobydock.png)

Note: beware of the browser cache that prevents the hostname to be updated sometimes

## Run 3 managers and 6 workers on AmazonEC2 based on ehazlett/docker-demo image (default image if none specified)

```
./swarm.sh --driver amazonec2 --amazonec2-access-key $AWS_ACCESS_KEY --amazonec2-secret-key $AWS_SECRET_KEY --amazonec2-security-group default --manager 3 --worker 6
```

note: make sure the security group provided (**default** in this example) allow communication between hosts and open the exposed port (8080 by default) to the outside
