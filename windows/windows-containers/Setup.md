# Setup

There are four environments you can use to set-up Windows Containers. We have provided separate guides for each:

+ [Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update](Setup-Win10.md "Windows 10 Setup")
+ [Windows Server 2016 on Azure](Setup-Azure.md "MS Azure Setup")
+ [Windows Server 2016 on AWS](Setup-AWS.md "AWS Setup")
+ [Windows Server 2016 on bare metal or in VM](Setup-Server2016.md "Setup on Windows 2016")

# Next Steps
See the [Microsoft documentation for more comprehensive instructions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/containers_welcome "Microsoft documentation").

After you have completed setup, you can continue to Step 2: [Getting Started with Windows Containers](WindowsContainers.md "Getting Started with Windows Containers")
