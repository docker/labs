[[Docker_Compose]]
= Run Multiple Containers Using Docker Compose

[quote, github.com/docker/compose]
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.

An application using Docker containers will typically consist of multiple containers. With Docker Compose, there is no need to write shell scripts to start your containers. All the containers are defined in a configuration file using _services_, and then `docker-compose` script is used to start, stop, and restart the application and all the services in that application, and all the containers within that service. The complete list of commands is:

[options="header"]
|====
| Command | Purpose
| `build` | Build or rebuild services
| `help` | Get help on a command
| `kill` | Kill containers
| `logs` | View output from containers
| `port` | Print the public port for a port binding
| `ps` | List containers
| `pull` | Pulls service images
| `restart` | Restart services
| `rm` | Remove stopped containers
| `run` | Run a one-off command
| `scale` | Set number of containers for a service
| `start` | Start services
| `stop` | Stop services
| `up` | Create and start containers
| `migrate-to-labels  Recreate containers to add labels
|====

The application used in this section will show how to query a Couchbase sample data using simple Java EE application deployed on WildFly. The Java EE application will use JAX-RS to publish REST endpoint which will then be invoked using `curl`.

WildFly and Couchbase will be running in two separate containers, and thus making this a multi-container application.

== Configuration File

. Entry point to Docker Compose is Compose file, usually called `docker-compose.yml`. Create a new directory and a new file `docker-compose.yml` in it. Use the following contents:

[[Docker_Compose_with_WildFly_and_Couchbase]]
.Docker Compose with WildFly and Couchbase
====
[source, yml]
----
version: '2'
services:
  db:
    image: arungupta/couchbase
    ports:
      - 8091:8091
      - 8092:8092 
      - 8093:8093 
      - 11210:11210
  web:
    image: arungupta/wildfly-couchbase-javaee7
    environment:
      - COUCHBASE_URI=db
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    depends_on:
      - db
----
====

In this Compose file:

. Two services in this Compose are defined by the name `db` and `web` attributes
. Image name for each service defined using `image` attribute
. The `arungupta/couchbase` image starts Couchbase server, configures it using http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/rest-api/rest-endpoints-all.html[Couchbase REST API], and loads a sample bucket
. The `arungupta/wildfly-couchbase-javaee7` image starts WildFly and deploys application WAR file built from https://github.com/arun-gupta/couchbase-javaee. This image built using https://github.com/arun-gupta/docker-images/blob/master/wildfly-couchbase-javaee7/Dockerfile.
. Environment variable for WildFly container is defined in `environment` attribute
. Couchbase container is linked with WildFly container using `COUCHBASE_URI`. This is used in the application code as shown at https://github.com/arun-gupta/couchbase-javaee/blob/master/src/main/java/org/couchbase/sample/javaee/Database.java#L44.
. Port forwarding is achieved using `ports` attribute
. `depends_on` attribute allows to express dependency between services. In this case, Couchbase will be started before WildFly. Application-level health are still user's responsibility.

=== Start Application

All services in the applicaiton can be started, in detached mode, by giving the command:

[[Start_Compose_Services]]
.Start Docker Compose Services
====
[source, text]
----
docker-compose up -d
----
====

An alternate compose file name can be specified using `-f` option.

An alternate directory where the compose file exists can be specified using `-p` option.

This shows the output as:

This provides a consolidated view of all the started services, and containers within them.

Alternatively, the containers in this application, and any additional containers running on this Docker host can be verified by using the usual `docker ps` command:

Service logs can be seen using `docker-compose logs` command. The logs will show some errors. These are because the Java EE application deployed in WildFly is not able to communicate with Couchbase. Let's understand why.

`depends_on` attribute in Compose definition file ensures the container start up order. But application-level start up needs to be ensured by the applications running inside container. In our case, WildFly starts up rather quickly but takes a few seconds for the database to start up. This means the Java EE application deployed in WildFly is not able to communicate with the database. 

So we need to restart the WildFly service after ~15 seconds to ensure enough time for the Couchbase database to start. Restart the WildFly service using `docker-compose restart web` command.

Now, the logs will show the application is deployed successfully in WildFly. This can be verified by looking at the logs:

Complete set of REST APIs for this application are explained at https://github.com/arun-gupta/couchbase-javaee.

== Stop Application

The application can be stopped using `docker-compose stop` command. This will remove the containers for each service defined in the Compose file, networks defined in the `networks` section of the Compose file, and the default network, if one is used.

Remove the application as:

[source, text]
----
docker-compose up -d
Creating network "javaee_default" with the default driver
Creating javaee_db_1
Creating javaee_web_1
javaee > docker-compose down

Stopping javaee_db_1 ... done
Removing javaee_web_1 ... done

----

Alternatively, services can be stopped using `docker-compose stop` command:

[source, text]
----
docker-compose stop
Stopping javaee_web_1 ... done
Stopping javaee_db_1 ... done
----

The containers can be removed using `docker-compose rm` command:
