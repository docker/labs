== Docker and IntelliJ IDEA

This chapter will show you basic Docker tooling with IntelliJ IDEA:

- Pull Docker images
- Run, stop, delete a Container
- Build an Image

=== Install Docker Plugin in IDEA

Go to `"Preferences"`, "`Plugins`", "`Install JetBrains plugin...`", search on "`docker`" and click on "`Install`"

Click on "`Create New Project`", select "`Java`", "`Web Application`"

Click on "`Next`", give the project a name "`dockercon`", click on "`Finish`". This will open up the project in IntelliJ window.

Go to "`Preferences`", "`Clouds`", add a new deployment by clicking on "`+`". Click on "`Import credentials from Docker Machine`", "`Detect`", and see a successful connection. You may have to check the IP address of your Docker Machine. Find the IP address of your Docker Machine as `docker-machine ip <machine-name>` and specify the correct IP address here.

=== Pull an Image

Select top-level node with the name "`Docker`", click on "`Pull image`"

Type an image name, such as `arungupta/couchbase`, and "`OK`"

image::docker-intellij-repository-name.png[]

Expand "`Containers`" and "`Images`" to see existing running containers and images.

The specified image is now downloaded and shown as well.

=== Run a Container

Select the downloaded image, click on "`Create container`"

Select "`After launch`" and enter the URL as `http://192.168.99.100:8091`. Make sure to match the IP address of your Docker Machine.

In "`Container`" tab, add "`Port bindings`" for `8091:8091`

image::docker-intellij-container-ports.png[]

Click on "`Run`" to run the container.

This will bring up the browser window and display the page http://192.168.99.100:8091 and looks like:

This image uses http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/rest-api/rest-endpoints-all.html[Couchbase REST API] to configure the Couchbase server. 

Right-click on the running container, select "`Inspect`" to see more details about the container.
