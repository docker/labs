The Linux kernel features an extremely mature and performant implementation of the TCP/IP stack (in addition to other native kernel features like DNS and VXLAN). Docker networking uses the kernel's networking stack as low level primitives to create higher level network drivers. Simply put, _Docker networking <b>is</b> Linux networking._ 

This implementation of existing Linux kernel features ensures high performance and robustness. Most importantly, it provides portability across many distributions and versions which enhances application portability.

There are several Linux networking building blocks which Docker uses to implement its built-in CNM network drivers. This list includes **Linux bridges**, **network namespaces**, **veth pairs**,  and **iptables**. The combination of these tools implemented as network drivers provide the forwarding rules, network segmentation, and management tools for complex network policy.

### <a name="linuxbridge"></a>The Linux Bridge
A **Linux bridge** is a Layer 2 device that is the virtual implementation of a physical switch inside the Linux kernel. It forwards traffic based on MAC addresses which it learns dynamically by inspecting traffic. Linux bridges are used extensively in many of the Docker network drivers. A Linux bridge is not to be confused with the `bridge` Docker network driver which is a higher level implementation of the Linux bridge.


### Network Namespaces
A Linux **network namespace** is an isolated network stack in the kernel with its own interfaces, routes, and firewall rules. It is a security aspect of containers and Linux, used to isolate containers. In networking terminology they are akin to a VRF that segments the network control and data plane inside the host. Network namespaces ensure that two containers on the same host will not be able to communicate with each other or even the host itself unless configured to do so via Docker networks. Typically, CNM network drivers implement separate namespaces for each container. However, containers can share the same network namespace or even be a part of the host's network namespace. The host network namespace containers the host interfaces and host routing table. This network namespace is called the global network namespace.

### Virtual Ethernet Devices
A **virtual ethernet device** or **veth** is a Linux networking interface that acts as a connecting wire between two network namespaces. A veth is a full duplex link that has a single interface in each namespace. Traffic in one interface is directed out the other interface. Docker network drivers utilize veths to provide explicit connections between namespaces when Docker networks are created. When a container is attached to a Docker network, one end of the veth is placed inside the container (usually seen as the `ethX` interface) while the other is attached to the Docker network. 

### iptables
**`iptables`** is the native packet filtering system that has been a part of the Linux kernel since version 2.4. It's a feature rich L3/L4 firewall that provides rule chains for packet marking, masquerading, and dropping. The built-in Docker network drivers utilize `iptables` extensively to segment network traffic, provide host port mapping, and to mark traffic for load balancing decisions.
